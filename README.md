# Introduction
This project is based on the existing experimental platform, namely the AWR1642 millimeter-wave radar and DCA1000EVM data capture card of Texas Instruments.  
The objectives is as follows,
* Set up the experimental environment and obtain good radar echo data.
* Process the echo signal and extract its time-domain, frequency-domain and time-frequency characteristics.
* Based on the extracted image features, key characteristics of the unmanned aerial vehicle, including distance, blade length, and rotation period, are systematically identified and computed.
* The experimental data should be verified based on multiple methods.

Only **part of the project** — specifically my own work — are showcased in this repository.  
Entire codes and workflow will not be presented because it's a Collaborative Research and Development Project based on platform in our lab. 

The approaches applied in this project are **not yet fully developed**. This repository mainly serves as a record and summary.  

Discussions are welcome.
